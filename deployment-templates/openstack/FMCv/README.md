## 3. FMCv template
Template file to create a FMCv instance and its flavor, security group, floating ip.

###     3.1 Parameters
The table below describes the parameters that the deploy_fmcv.yaml template file uses to create the resources and provides the default value, if applicable.

| Variables | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| fmcv_flavor_name | Name of the flavor used for deploying FMCv. Flavor with the provided name will be created. (flavor is an hardware configuration for a VM). |
| glance_fmcv_image_name | The name of FMCv QCOW2 image uploaded to OpenStack glance service using openstack image create command. |
| fmcv_secgroup_name | Name of the security group used for FMCv. Security group with the provided name will be created. (A security group defines the rules which specify the network access rules.) |
