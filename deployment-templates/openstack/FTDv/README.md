###     3.1 Parameters
The table below describes the parameters that the deploy_ftdv.yaml template file uses to create the resources and provides the default value, if applicable.

| Variables | Description |
| ------ | ------ |
| ftdv_flavor_name | Name of the flavor used for deploying FTDv. Flavor with the provided name will be created. (flavor is an hardware configuration for a VM). |
